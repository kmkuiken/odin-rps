This is a simple site that allows users to play Rock Paper Scissors against a computer opponent.
Users are able to play an infinite game of rock paper scissors against a computer 
opponent.

This project shows the importance of impact and animations on a good user experience.
When first developing functionality, the immediate results were somewhat of a letdown
and made the game very boring.  When you get the results imediately, it just felt like
clicking buttons instead of actually playing a game.  Now that there is a bit of a 
buildup before the user gets the results of the game, it adds a little suspense 
and makes the experience feel more like an actual game.
